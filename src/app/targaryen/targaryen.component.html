<h3>Family Info:</h3>
<p>
  House Targaryen of King's Landing is a Great House of Westeros and the current ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms. House Targaryen conquered and unified the realm before it was deposed during <br> Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced it as the new royal House. 
<br>
  The two surviving Targaryens fled into exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea. House Lannister replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor,  <br>but the realm was reconquered by Daenerys Targaryen, retaking the Iron Throne following the Battle of King's Landing.
<br>
House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a black background, and their house words are "Fire and Blood."
