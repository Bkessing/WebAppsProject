<h3>Info:</h3>
<p style="color: red">
  House Targaryen of Dragonstone is a Great House of Westeros
  <br>
  and the current ruling royal House of the Seven Kingdoms. 
   <br>
   House Targaryen conquered and unified the realm before it 
   <br>
   was deposed during Robert's Rebellion and House Baratheon replaced 
   <br>
   it as the new royal House. The two surviving Targaryens fled into 
   <br>
   exile to the Free Cities of Essos across the Narrow Sea. 
   <br>
   House Lannister replaced House Baratheon as the royal House following 
   <br>
   the destruction of the Great Sept of Baelor, but the realm was
   <br>
   reconquered by Daenerys Targaryen, retaking the Iron Throne following 
    <br>
    the Battle of King's Landing.
  <br>
  House Targaryen's sigil is a three-headed red dragon on a 
  <br>
  black background, and their house words are "Fire and Blood."
