# Web of Thrones

Game of Thrones is an American fantasy drama television series created by David Benioff and D. B. Weiss. It is an adaptation of A Song of Ice and Fire, George R. R. Martin's series of fantasy novels, the first of which is A Game of Thrones. Game of Thrones has attracted record viewership on HBO and has a broad, active, international fan base. It has been acclaimed by critics, particularly for its acting, complex characters, story, scope, and production values. 

Utilizing its global popularity and name recognition, it is our groups belief that creation of a high-end web site for HBO would increase the interest of the show, drive traffic to HBO's website and provide a lasting tribute to the world of George R. R. Martin's creation. We plan to do this by creating a map of Westeros that will be segmented by the main areas and families that the books focus on. Users will be able to traverse the map, click on interesting cities and learn about the histories of the families that rule over them.
